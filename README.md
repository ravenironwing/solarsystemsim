# solarsystemsim
A basic gravity simulator that uses particles to simulate the formation of solar systems.

The simulator starts out by simulating particles dispersed in the explosion of a supernova.
The simulated gravitational and electromagnetic forces then pull the particles together into planets that orbit a central second generation star.
